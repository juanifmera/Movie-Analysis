Movies Correlation Analysis

🎬 Welcome to the Movies Correlation Analysis Project! 🎬

Dive into the fascinating world of cinema data analysis with this project that uncovers the correlations between various movie features. Whether you're a data enthusiast or a movie buff, this repository offers insightful analysis and visualization of movie data.

🚀 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of movies to explore the relationships between different features such as budget, gross earnings, ratings, and more. The goal is to identify significant correlations that can provide valuable insights into how different factors affect a movie's financial performance and other aspects.

🔍 Features
Data Cleaning: The dataset is meticulously cleaned to handle missing values and ensure data integrity. This includes filling missing values with column means and dropping unnecessary NA values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project includes detailed EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of various movie features.

Visualization: Several visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Scatter Plot: Examines the relationship between budget and gross earnings, with different colors representing movie genres.
Regression Plot: Shows the linear relationship between budget and gross earnings.
Correlation Matrix: Provides a heatmap of correlations between numeric features and another heatmap for all features after converting categorical data to numerical codes.
Correlation Analysis: Identifies strong correlations between features, such as the relationship between votes, budget, and gross earnings.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations.

📊 Key Insights
Budget vs. Gross Earnings: A scatter plot and regression analysis reveal the relationship between a film's budget and its gross revenue.
Correlation Heatmaps: Show the strength of correlations between different numerical features and all features in the dataset.
Votes and Budget: High correlation with gross earnings indicates that both votes and budget are significant factors in a movie's financial success.
